Project Title: Implementing a Vector Search-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

Project Description 
For my final project, I will develop a practical information retrieval system using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This project will focus on the core concepts of document processing, vector-based indexing, and query-based retrieval to provide contextual information to a Large Language Model (LLM).
The system will ingest a collection of text documents, process them into manageable chunks, and then convert these chunks into numerical representations (vector embeddings). These embeddings will be stored and indexed in a vector database for efficient similarity searching. When a user submits a query, the system will retrieve the most relevant document chunks from the database and provide them to an LLM as context, enabling the model to generate accurate, source-based answers.

This project will provide hands-on experience with:
•	I will implement a complete pipeline from document ingestion and representation to indexing and retrieval.
•	The project is a practical application of the vector space model, where documents and queries are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
•	I plan to evaluate the system's performance by testing its ability to answer questions that can only be resolved using information contained within the source documents.
The final deliverable will be the functioning code for the RAG system, likely submitted as a URL to a code repository.
